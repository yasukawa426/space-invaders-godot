## Game 3 of 20 - Space Invaders

The focus of this game is creating all the art (and maybe the OST) myself. I'll be creating the pixel art using [LibreSprite](https://libresprite.github.io/#!/). I also changed the theme a bit, instead of aliens, angels are invading Earth. 

### Gameplay

### Goals
- [ ] Art
  - [ ] Player ship
  - [ ] 4 aliens (angel) types
  - [ ] Special Invader (UFO equivalent)
- [ ] Create a player ship that moves side to side
- [ ] Multiple types of alien invaders (around 4)
  - [ ] Enemies will move together in a grid. They cross the screen horizontally before dropping vertically and reversing their direction
- [ ] Add the ability for the player ship to fire rockets that travel up the screen
- [ ] Add bombs/bullets that the enemies drop. The player’s rockets can destroy enemy bullets
- [ ] Make sure that the player’s bullets will destroy invaders, and the invader bullets will destroy the player
- [ ] Add a UI that tracks the player score and lives left. The player starts with three lives
- [ ] Add sound effects (shooting, hit, music, gameover, etc)
### Bonus
- [ ] Shield protecting Earth that can take  ~3 hits
  - [ ] Shield gets visually weaker the lower the health 
- [ ] Destroyed Earth art
- [ ] Tons of effects?!?! (particles, screen shake, sounds, shaders, etc)
- [ ] Add scaling difficulty based on something (faster enemies, more bullets?)
- [ ] Biblical accurate angel boss fight with epic music????
- [ ] A portrait for the mc? (probably not tho. idk how to draw)
